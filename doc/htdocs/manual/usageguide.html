<p>
The SignServer administration command line interface (Admin CLI) is started
using bin/signserver (or bin/signserver.cmd).
                </p>
                
<p>
Every worker is identified by an ID and an optional name that can be used in all
the CLI commands.
                </p>
                
<p>
It is possible to do configuration of a worker while it's in production. All
configuration commands are cached until a reload command is issued and the
configuration becomes active.
                </p>
                
<p>
There is a special property file for the cli interface called signserver_cli.properties defining which nodes that exists in the cluster. The properties are:
                </p>
                
<p>
<b>hostname.masternode</b> = Should only contain one of the nodes, specified as the default master node. Used by operations dealing with the database and where not all nodes in the cluster needs to be contacted. It is possible to override this setting in the CLI by using the -host &lt;host name&gt; parameter.
                </p>
                
<p>
<b>hostname.allnodes</b> = Should contain all the nodes in the cluster, separated by a ';'. Mainly used by the commands getStatus, activateCryptoToken and deactivateCryptoToken.
                </p>
                
<p>
Its possible to customize the CLI with your own code. How to do this is described in the development section.
                </p>

This tool will dump all configured properties for one or all workers in the system into a property file. If the configuration for one worker is dumped it can be used to transfer the configuration from one installation to another. If all configurations is dumped, it can be used as a backup tool.
                        </p>
                        
<p>
<b>uploadsignercertificate:</b>
Used to upload the certificate when the worker only needs the actual signing certificate and not the entire chain.

<p>
<b>uploadsignercertificatechain:</b>
Used when uploading a complete certificate chain to the worker. Which command that is supposed to be used is depending on the worker and crypto token used.

<p>
<b>importcertificatechain:</b>
Used to import a certificate chain into a crypto token. It takes a worker ID of the crypto worker
(or a worker ID of a worker with the crypto token configured in the legacy way)
and a path pointing to a file containing the certificate chain and a key alias to import to.
This is currently supported by the PKCS11 and keystore crypto token implementations.

<p>
<b>generatecertreq:</b>
Used to generate a certificate request for a worker to be signed by a certificate authority. It takes
distinguished name and signature algorithm as parameters and writes the request in PEM format to
file. An optional key alias can be specified to generate a request given a specific key alias
from the crypto token.

<b>addauthorizedclient:</b>
Adds a client certificate to a processable workers list of acceptable clients using this worker. Specify
certificate serial number in hex and the Issuer DN of the client certificate.
If DN components contains commas, these needs to be escaped with backslashes.
Alternatively a certificate file (PEM or DER format) can be specified,
from which the serial number and issuer DN is fetched.

<b>renewsigner:</b>
Sends a request for renewal of the specified worker to the specified renewal worker. If the authcode parameter is omitted the command will renew the certificate without an authcode, assuming the crypto token is auto-activated or the worker is using a separate crypto worker (recommended).
To get the old behaviour of prompting for the authcode, specify the -authprompt option. When the authcode is not passed as a parameter or prompted for, an explicit activation of the token will not be performed.

<p>
The 'resync' command is used after a SignServer had a complete database failure. When this happens  will the Global Configuration become in 'Off-line' mode and it's not possible for the nodes to communicate internally and the Global Configurations will not be in sync any more. After the database is up again can this command be sent to the node that have the most valid Global Configuration and write it to the database. After this will the Global Configuration be in 'On-line' mode again.

This commands can be used for processable workers that have archiving turned on. They 
are used to find specific archived responses. It's up to the implementation of the 
worker if it supports archiving or not and it is up to the chosen Archiver if it 
archives the data in way that it can be queried using this commands. For Archivers 
other than the default &quot;OldDatabaseArchiver&quot; and Base64DatabaseArchiver querying 
might have to be done directly in a database, filesystem or by some custom 
application.

The SignServer Database CLI uses Java Persistence API (JPA) to connect to the 
SignServer database. The CLI is configured by the dbcli.* properties in 
signserver_cli.properties.
                    </p>
                    
<p>
The CLI needs to have the JDBC driver of the selected database available on the 
classpath. This can be achieved by setting the OPTIONAL_CLASSPATH environment 
variable when calling the bin/signserver-db script or by putting the JAR under
lib/ext/jdbc/ and calling it jdbc.jar. The last method is required to be able 
to run the JUnit tests. 
                    </p>

       verifylog [-node NODENAME[:OFFSET] ...]

Verifies logs from all nodes starting at sequence number 0 or only from the specified nodes and optional sequence number offsets specified.
If the nodename is suffixed with a colon and an number then the verification for that node is started from that sequence number.
The JDBC connector of the database might have to be put on the classpath. See the example below.

Example: a) signserver-db audit verifylog -all
Example: b) signserver-db audit verifylog -node server1 -node server2:708

<h4><a name="Archiving_of_the_audit_log"></a>Archiving of the audit log</h4>
                        
<p>
As the Database CLI audit verifylog command checks for gabs in the sequence numbering entries from the audit log can not be archived/moved to other storage without special care.
However since the command now supports the option to specify from which sequence number to start the verification the following scheme for archiving is proposed:                            
                        </p>
                        
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
                            
<li>
Run the command to verify the complete log audit log:

<div>
<pre class="code">audit verifylog -all</pre></div>
Note down the last sequence number for each node. Ie:

<div>
<pre class="code">Last sequences: {server1=2, server2=7}</pre></div>
                            </li>
                            
<li>
All entries from 0 up to the entry before the last can now be archived and removed from the database. In our example that would be entry 0 and 1 for node server1 and entries from 0 to 6 for node server2.                                
                            </li>
                            
<li>
The next time the log should be verified start the verification from the last sequence numbers:

<div>
<pre class="code">audit verifylog -node server1:2 -node server2:7</pre></div>
Again note down the last sequence number for each node and all entries up to the sequence number before the last for each node can now be archived.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

<div class="content">It is important to not remove the row with the last sequence number for any node as if the application is restarted the sequence numbering would than start again from 0 for that node.</div>

When selecting &quot;Load from file&quot; it is possible to load a configuration file. This is equivalent of the &quot;setproperties&quot; <a href="usageguide.html#Administration_CLI">Admin CLI</a> command. Selecting &quot;Add worker&quot; enables setting up a worker from scratch by manually specifying a worker ID (the default selected will generate an ID dynamically), worker name, fully qualified class name for the implementation, and (optionally) a signer token implementation. Additional properties can be added using the table below. When the required parameters are given, the &quot;Next&quot; button will enable moving to the next step where additional manual editing of the resulting configuration can be made (the format is the same as the worker properties files). Clicking the &quot;Apply&quot; button from this stage will load the current configuration. The dialog can be dismissed in both states using the &quot;Cancel&quot; button.

Allows adding webservice administrators, auditors, and archive auditors.
The administrators can be added by explicitly entering the client certificate's
serial number in hexadecimal (leading zeroes and letter case is not significant)
and the issuer DN with space after each comma separating DN components.
If DN components contains commas, these needs to be escaped with backslashes.
                        </p>
                        
<p>
An example using a certificate issued from EJBCA with the default (as specified by EJBCA) LDAP DN order:
                        </p>

<div class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">
C=SE, O=TestOrganization, CN=IssuingCA
</pre></div>
                        
<p>
This is the reversed order compared to how the issuer DN is stored in the certificate.

An example using a certificate issued from EJBCA with the Use LDAP DN order option disabled:

Fill in the alias of the new key that should be generated as well as the key type (i.e. RSA, DSA or ECDSA) as well as the the key specification (i.e. key length such as &quot;2048&quot; for RSA and DSA or curve name such as &quot;secp256r1&quot; for ECDSA).
For RSA keys, a custom public exponent can be expressed as part of the key specification by entering a value such as &quot;2048 exp 5&quot; or &quot;2048 exp 0x10001&quot;, expressing the exponent value in decimal or hexadecimal form.
After filling in a key alias a new row will automatically added which allows for generating more keys.

<p>
The card prompts for the PIN but then doesn't ask for which certificate to login with.
Instead an error message with the text &quot;Received fatal alert: bad_certificate&quot; is displayed.
This error message indicates that the server did not accept the provided certificate (ie, the issuer was not in the server's truststore). However, in this case the error could be because no certificate was possible to read from the card.
This has been observed with some type of smart cards.

<h3><a name="Working_with_Workers"></a>Working with Workers</h3>
                    
<p>
In SignServer operations are performed by workers. There can be many workers 
and each worker has its own configuration. Each worker is identified by an unique 
ID. A worker can also be configured with a name by setting the property NAME. 
After the configuration has been activated (by issuing reload with the worker ID) 
that name can also be used to address the worker.

<div class="section">
<h4><a name="Configuring"></a>Configuring</h4>
                        
<p>
A worker is configured by setting properties for it. Specifically if the plugin
is built-in it is specified by setting the property CLASSPATH to the fully
qualified name of the class implementing the plugin.
                        </p>

The properties can be set manually using the setproperty command or by loading
them all at once from a configuration file using the setproperties command.
Sample configuration files are available in SIGNSERVER_HOME/sample-configs.

<h3><a name="HTTP_access_requires_a_load_balancer"></a>HTTP access requires a load balancer</h3>
                    
<p>
HTTP based workers like the TSA can be clustered using a load balancer accessing a health check servlet returning the state of the SignServer. The basic settings of the health check servlet can be configured in the build configuration file but more advanced settings are done in 'src/web/healthcheck/WEB-INF/web.xml'. With the default settings will the servlet return the text 'ALLOK' when accessing the URL http://localhost:8080/signserver/healthcheck/signserverhealth. If something is wrong with SignServer, an error message will be sent back instead.
                    </p>
                    
<p>
The health check servlet can also be used to monitor the SignServer by creating a script that monitors the URL periodically for error messages.
                    </p>

Tip, heartbeat with ldirectord is a good solution for a load balancer and works well with the SignServer. KeepAlived is another open source solution.

In SignServer there exists a health check service that can be used for health monitoring. It is also useful for cluster, as it can be checked by load balancers to determine if a node should be active in the cluster (healthy) or taken out of the cluster (unhealthy).
                    </p>
                    
<p>
The servlet is located at the URL: http://localhost:8080/signserver/healthcheck/signserverhealth and configured in signserver_deploy.properties.
                    </p>
                    
<p>
The following configuration parameters may be set to configure authorization and what the service checks: 
                    </p>
                    
<p>
</p>
<div class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">healthcheck.authorizedips</pre></div> - A semicolon-delimited list of IP addresses authorized to access
the healthcheck servlet, if the list contains the keyword &quot;ANY&quot;, any IP address is authorized access (defaults to <tt>127.0.0.1</tt>).
                    
                    
<p>
</p>
<div class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">healthcheck.minimumfreememory</pre></div> - Number of megabytes of memory that must be free before removing     
the node out of the cluster (defaults to 1).
                    
                    
<p>
</p>
<div class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">healthcheck.checkdbstring</pre></div> - The string that should be used to do 
a minimal check that the database is working. May differ between databases.
(defaults to <tt>Select count(*) from signerconfigdata</tt>, the property is not used when running without database).
                    
                    
<p>
</p>
<div class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">healthcheck.maintenancefile</pre></div> - The path to a file containing the maintenance state, this file is a
standard Java property file and should have a property (by default named <tt>DOWN_FOR_MAINTENANCE</tt>&quot;).
If this property has the value <tt>true</tt>, none of the standard health checks will be performed, and instead
the result will be a string of the form <tt>MAINT: DOWN_FOR_MAINTENANCE</tt>.
If this property is not set (or an invalid file is given), the maintenance functionallity is disabled.
                    
                    
<p>
</p>
<div class="source"><pre class="prettyprint">healthcheck.maintenancepropertyname</pre></div> - The property name to be used in the maintenance file. This will also
affect the error message returned when in maintenance mode (the part of the string after <tt>MAINT:</tt> 
(defaults to <tt>DOWN_FOR_MAINTENANCE</tt>).
