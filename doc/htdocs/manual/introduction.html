The SignServer is an application framework performing cryptographic operations
for other applications. It's intended to be used in environments where keys are
supposed to be protected in hardware but it isn't possible to connect such
hardware to existing enterprise applications or where the operations are
considered extra sensitive so the hardware have to protected more carefully.
Another usage is to provide a simplified method to provide signatures in
different application managed from one location in the company.
                </p>
                
<p>
The SignServer have been designed for high-availability and can be clustered for maximum
reliability.
                </p>
                
<p>
SignServer comes with a RFC 3161/5816 compliant Time-Stamp signer serving requests through
HTTP or client-authenticated HTTPS. A MRTD (Machine Readable Travel Document, i.e. electronic
passport) signer. A PDF signer that adds a signature automatically to an uploaded PDF document,
ODF signer that adds a signature automatically to uploaded ODF document, OOXML Signer that
adds signature automatically to an uploaded OOXML document, and a validation service used to
lookup the validation of a given certificate.

cluster. All the resource data including the classes themselves are stored in database and
accessible from all nodes simultaneously. It is also possible to run multiple versions of the
same worker in the same SignServer cluster, this is useful when migrating a worker to new
code since both the old and new worker can be run at the same time.

<h2><a name="Overall_Architecture"></a>Overall Architecture</h2>
                    
<p>
The SignServer is a framework designed to perform different kind of cryptographic operations for different applications.
                    </p>
                    
<p>
Since the 3.0 version there are three kind of processable services. Signers (used to sign or in other way  process requested data). Validation Services used to verify the validity of a certificate against a set of backed issuers. The validation service can be used to simply the integration of PKIs into existing applications. In addition to processable services there also exists another concept called Timed Service (called just 'service' in 2.0 edition) which are plug-ins run at defined intervals performing maintenance or reporting routines.
                    </p>
                    
<p>
The main way of communicating with the SignServer is through HTTP (web server) interface. There is also a web services (SOAP WS) interface available but that uses a special binary format for encoding the requests and responses.
                    </p>
                    
<p>
The base component is called Worker which is assigned an ID, optionally a name and a configuration. A sub component is a Processable which receives and processes requests. A Processable (optionally) have access to a cryptographic token (CryptoToken) in charge of managing the keys of a Processable. A CryptoToken can be either software or hardware based.
                    </p>
                    
<p>
The application is administrated through a command-line interface, where the properties and access control can be configured.
                    </p>
                    
<p>
One SignServer can have multiple services for different purposes.
